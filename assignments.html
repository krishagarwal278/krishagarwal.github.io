								<h1>Assignment 1 </h1>
								<p> The dataset for this task is the elevator arrival times on the ground floor in CDS building at Boston Univeristy. 
									Using this dataset, you will determine the best location to wait in order to minimize the expected walking distance 
									to the next arriving elevator.

								<p>KMeans Clustering Visualization
									This project is an interactive web application that showcases the workings of the KMeans clustering 
									algorithm with multiple initialization methods. Explore how different approaches affect the clustering 
									process with real-time, step-by-step visualizations.</p>

								<h1>Assignment 3</h1>
								<p>SVD Preprocessing on MNIST with Logistic Regression
									In this repo, I am implementing the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm from scratch. 
									I am also using the SVD to perform dimensionality reduction on a dataset, explore the effect of the number of 
									dimensions on the performance of a classifier, and visualize my results for comparison and analysis. </p>

								<h1>Assignment 4</h1>
								<p>Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) Search Engine
									In this repo, I have developed an interactive web application that implements a basic search
									engine using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA).
									The search engine will take a user’s query, perform LSA on a pool of documents, and return the top 
									documents based on cosine similarity. </p>

								<h1>Assignment 5</h1>
								<p>K-Nearest Neighbors Kaggle Competition
									In this repo, I implement a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model from scratch to predict 
									customer churn for a bank. My goal was to identify customers who are likely to leave the 
									bank based on historical data. I then submitted my predictions in a mini Kaggle competition.

								<h1>Midterm: Kaggle Competition </h1>
								<p>This project aims to predict star ratings for Amazon movie reviews based on the review text and metadata. 
									The primary objective is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify reviews into 1-5 star 
									ratings by extracting meaningful insights and patterns from the available data. The project avoids deep learning methods, 
									focusing on feature engineering and traditional machine learning techniques.

								<h1>Assignment 7 </h1>
								<p>This project aims to extend my previous work from Assignment 6 to include hypothesis 
									testing and confidence intervals through simulations. You’ll enhance your interactive webpage to allow users to 
									perform hypothesis tests on the slope or intercept of the regression line and generate confidence intervals based on 
									simulations

								<h1>Assignment 8 </h1>
								<p>This project implements an experiment to study the effects of shifting clusters on logistic regression parameters. 
									The experiment generates two ellipsoid clusters with configurable shifts and fits a logistic regression model to observe 
									how parameters such as coefficients, intercept, logistic loss, and decision boundaries change with increasing separation 
									between the clusters.
